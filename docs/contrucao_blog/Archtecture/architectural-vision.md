# Architectural Vision

This document outlines the technical architecture for the Stelarow Integrated Blog. The primary goal is to create a robust and performant blog platform that is deeply integrated into the existing Stelarow monorepo, sharing the same technology stack (Next.js 14, Supabase, Vercel) and design system.

The architecture is designed for:
* **Synergy & Reusability:** Leveraging the existing monorepo to share components, types, authentication, and utilities, reducing code duplication and accelerating development.
* **Performance:** Utilizing Next.js Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) for fast page loads and excellent SEO.
* **Scalability:** Building on the scalable, serverless infrastructure provided by Vercel and Supabase.
* **Maintainability:** Ensuring a clear separation of concerns and a logical folder structure to facilitate future development and maintenance.
