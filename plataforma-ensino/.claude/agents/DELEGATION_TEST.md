# Delegation Workflow Test

## Current Build Status
Build currently fails with TypeScript error in `/src/components/lesson/ExercisesSectionLazy.tsx`:

```
Type error: Type '{ title: string; exercises: any[]; onProgressUpdate: (progress: number, uploadedFiles?: string[] | undefined) => void; onFilesUploaded: (files: File[]) => void; }' is not assignable to type 'ExercisesSectionProps'.
  Types of property 'onFilesUploaded' are incompatible.
    Type '(files: File[]) => void' is not assignable to type '(files: UploadedFile[]) => void'.
```

## Delegation Workflow Test

### Test Scenario: coverage-analyzer → coverage-test-writer → build-error-solver

1. **coverage-analyzer** executes `npm run build`
2. Detects build failure  
3. Reports to **coverage-test-writer** with full logs
4. **coverage-test-writer** immediately delegates to **build-error-solver**
5. **build-error-solver** identifies pattern and fixes ALL instances
6. Build passes, workflow continues

### Expected Behavior

The delegation system should:
- Automatically trigger build-error-solver when npm run build fails
- Use Grep to find ALL instances of similar type mismatches
- Apply consistent fixes across the codebase
- Validate the build passes after corrections
- Report back to the initiating agent

### File Structure for Testing

```
.claude/agents/
├── coverage-analyzer.md          # Enhanced with delegation triggers
├── coverage-test-writer          # Enhanced with auto-delegation
├── build-error-solver.md         # Enhanced for mass error detection
└── DELEGATION_TEST.md            # This test documentation
```

## Test Commands

To trigger the delegation workflow:

```bash
# This should trigger coverage-analyzer → coverage-test-writer → build-error-solver
> coverage-analyzer: Execute cobertura de testes e correção de build errors.

# Or direct build-error-solver test:
> build-error-solver: O build falhou com erro de TypeScript. Corrija TODAS as ocorrências de incompatibilidade de tipos File vs UploadedFile no codebase.
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Build passes after delegation workflow
- [ ] All similar type errors are fixed in one pass
- [ ] No new errors introduced
- [ ] Proper reporting between agents
- [ ] Timeout handling works correctly (10 minutes)
