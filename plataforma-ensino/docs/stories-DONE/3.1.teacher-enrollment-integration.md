```

**Authentication:** Use existing Supabase Auth middleware, public read access for availability

### Integration Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/01-integration-strategy.md]

**Existing Enrollment Flow Integration:**
1. Student selects course from catalog (existing functionality)
2. TeacherSelector component renders in enrollment form (new)
3. ConditionalCalendar appears after teacher selection (new)
4. Time slot selection integrates with existing form state
5. Booking completion follows existing payment and confirmation flow

**Compatibility Requirements:**
- Must use existing design system (Habilidade colors, Tailwind CSS patterns)
- Follow existing form validation patterns with React Hook Form + Zod
- Integrate with existing authentication and user management
- Preserve existing enrollment flow for courses without teacher requirements
- Maintain performance benchmarks and error handling patterns

### Database Schema Context
[Source: Previous stories and database/schema.sql]

```sql
CREATE TABLE teacher_availability (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    teacher_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES teachers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    day_of_week INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (day_of_week >= 0 AND day_of_week <= 6),
    start_time TIME NOT NULL,
    end_time TIME NOT NULL,
    max_students INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 10,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Holidays Table Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE holidays (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    year INTEGER NOT NULL,
    is_national BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Row Level Security:** Existing RLS policies ensure proper access control for teacher data

### Shared Utilities Available
[Source: docs/architecture/03-component-architecture.md]

**Date Calculation Utilities:** `/src/utils/dateCalculations.ts`
```typescript
export function calculateCourseEndDate(
  startDate: Date,
  courseHours: number,
  weeklyClasses: number,
  holidayDates: Date[]
): CourseSchedule;

export function getHolidaysInRange(
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date,
  holidays: Holiday[]
): Holiday[];
```

**Teacher Availability Logic:** `/src/utils/teacherAvailabilityLogic.ts` - Business logic for availability calculations

### Real-time Updates Implementation
[Source: Previous story patterns established in 2.1/2.2]

**Supabase Realtime Patterns:**
```typescript
// Teacher availability updates
const availabilitySubscription = supabase
  .channel('availability_changes')
  .on('postgres_changes',
    { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'teacher_availability' },
    (payload) => updateAvailabilityState(payload)
  )
  .subscribe();
```

### Performance Optimization Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/03-component-architecture.md]

**Component Optimization:**
- React.memo for expensive calendar calculations
- Lazy loading for calendar months on demand
- Debounced updates for teacher availability
- Virtual scrolling for large teacher lists if needed

**Bundle Size Considerations:**
- Code splitting for calendar components
- Reuse existing UI component library
- Tree shaking for unused utilities

### Error Handling and Validation
[Source: Existing patterns from Stories 2.1/2.2]

**Form Validation Schemas (Zod):**
```typescript
const TeacherSelectionSchema = z.object({
  teacherId: z.string().uuid(),
  timeSlotId: z.string().uuid(),
  startDate: z.string().regex(/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/),
  startTime: z.string().regex(/^\d{2}:\d{2}$/)
});
```

**Error Handling Pattern:**
- Use existing `handleApiError` from `/src/lib/utils/api-error-handler.ts`
- Integrate with Sentry for error tracking: `captureException`
- Standard error codes: `TEACHER_NOT_FOUND`, `NO_AVAILABILITY`, `CAPACITY_EXCEEDED`

### Design System Integration
[Source: Existing enrollment flow patterns]

**UI Components to Use:**
- Existing design system components from `/src/components/ui/`
- Follow existing enrollment form styling and layout patterns
- Use existing form validation error display components
- Leverage existing loading state and spinner components
- Maintain existing responsive breakpoints and mobile design
