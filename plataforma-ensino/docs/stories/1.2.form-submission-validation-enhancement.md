# Story 1.2: Form Submission and Validation Enhancement

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As an** Administrator,
**I want** the enrollment form to validate and submit properly for both online and in-person enrollments,
**so that** in-person enrollments require teacher and schedule selection while online enrollments can be submitted without scheduling information.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Online Enrollment Validation**: When "Curso Presencial" is unchecked, the form can be submitted successfully without teacher or schedule selection
2. **In-person Enrollment Validation**: When "Curso Presencial" is checked, form validation must fail if:
   - No teacher is selected from TeacherSelector
   - No time slots are selected in ConditionalCalendar
   - For "Duas aulas por semana" checkbox checked: exactly two distinct time slots are not selected
3. **Form Submission Enhancement**: The form submission process properly handles the new `modality` field and `schedules` data structure according to the API specification
4. **Error Display**: Clear validation error messages are displayed for missing required fields in the scheduling section
5. **API Integration**: Successful form submission creates enrollment records with proper scheduling data in the database via the enhanced API endpoints

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Enhance form validation schema (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Add conditional validation for in-person enrollments using Zod
  - [ ] Implement teacher selection validation (required when is_in_person = true)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 successfully implemented the conditional display of the SchedulingSection component. The form now properly shows/hides scheduling fields based on the "Curso Presencial" checkbox state. The SchedulingSection component correctly integrates TeacherSelector and ConditionalCalendar with proper form field registration and clearing logic.

### Data Models
**StudentSchedule Model**: Required for storing in-person class schedules
- `enrollment_id`: Foreign key to enrollments table
- `instructor_id`: Foreign key to instructors table  
- `day_of_week`: Integer (1-7 for Monday-Sunday)
- `start_time`: Time format (HH:MM:SS)
- `end_time`: Time format (HH:MM:SS)

**Enrollments Table Enhancement**:
- `modality`: Text field ("online" or "in-person") with default "online"

### API Specifications
**Enhanced Enrollment API Endpoints**:
- **POST /api/enrollments**: Create new enrollment with optional schedules array
- **PUT /api/enrollments/{id}**: Update existing enrollment with optional schedules array

**Request Payload Structure**:
```json
{
  "student_id": "uuid",
  "course_id": "uuid", 
  "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "modality": "in-person", // or "online"
  "schedules": [
    {
      "instructor_id": "uuid",
      "day_of_week": 2, // 1=Monday, 7=Sunday
      "start_time": "10:00:00",
      "end_time": "11:00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response Structure**: API returns enrollment with embedded schedules array
[Source: architecture/6-design-e-integrao-de-api.md#62-endpoints-de-api-modificados]

### Component Specifications
**EnrollmentForm Enhancement**:
- Add conditional Zod validation schema based on `is_in_person` field state
- Implement form data transformation for API payload structure
- Handle schedule data mapping from ConditionalCalendar selection format to API format
- Integrate with existing react-hook-form validation patterns

**Form Validation Logic**:
- Online enrollments: No scheduling fields required
- In-person enrollments: Teacher and schedule selection mandatory
- Two classes per week: Exactly 2 distinct time slots required

   {loadingUsers && <UserSelectionSkeleton />}
   ```

2. **Accessibility Improvements:**
   ```typescript
   // Add ARIA labels for better screen reader support
   aria-describedby="teacher-selection-help"
   ```

3. **Form Persistence:**
   ```typescript
   // Consider localStorage backup for form data
   const backupFormData = () => localStorage.setItem('enrollmentDraft', JSON.stringify(formData))
   ```

4. **Validation Feedback Timing:**
   ```typescript
   // Could add debounced validation for better UX
   useEffect(() => {
     const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => validateForm(), 500)
     return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId)
   }, [formData])
   ```
