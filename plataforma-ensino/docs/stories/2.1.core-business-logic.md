### Data Models and Schema References
[Source: docs/architecture/02-data-models.md]

**Holidays Table Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE holidays (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    year INTEGER NOT NULL,
    is_national BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Teacher Availability Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE teacher_availability (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    teacher_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES teachers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    day_of_week INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (day_of_week >= 0 AND day_of_week <= 6),
    start_time TIME NOT NULL,
    end_time TIME NOT NULL,
    max_students INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 10,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Enhanced Teachers Table:**
- `max_students_per_class INTEGER DEFAULT 10` - Default class capacity
- `calendar_settings JSONB DEFAULT '{}'` - Flexible scheduling preferences

### File Locations Based on Project Structure
[Source: docs/architecture/01-integration-strategy.md]
- **API Endpoints:** `/src/app/api/calculate-end-date/route.ts`
- **Utility Functions:** `/src/utils/dateCalculations.ts`, `/src/utils/teacherAvailabilityLogic.ts`
- **Type Definitions:** Extend existing `/src/types/api.ts`
- **Validation Schemas:** Extend existing `/src/lib/validators/api-schemas.ts`
- **Tests:** `/__tests__/utils/dateCalculations.test.ts`, `/__tests__/api/calculate-end-date.test.ts`

### Authentication and Authorization
[Source: docs/architecture/04-api-design.md]
- **Permission Level:** Authenticated users only (students, teachers, admins)
- **Middleware Integration:** Use existing `authMiddleware` from `/src/lib/middleware/api-auth.ts`
- **Rate Limiting:** 50 requests/minute per user (expensive calculation operations)

### Performance and Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/architecture/04-api-design.md]
- **Response Time Target:** <200ms for date calculations
- **Concurrent Users:** Support multiple simultaneous calculations
- **Holiday Query Optimization:** Use existing indexes on holidays(date) and holidays(year)
- **Real-time Integration:** Supabase realtime for availability updates
- **Caching Strategy:** Consider caching holiday data for current/next year

### Error Handling Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/04-api-design.md]

Standard Error Codes to Implement:
- `TEACHER_NOT_FOUND` - Teacher ID not found
- `NO_AVAILABILITY` - Teacher has no available time slots
- `HOLIDAY_CONFLICT` - Requested date conflicts with holiday
- `INVALID_DATE_RANGE` - Start date after end date
- `CAPACITY_EXCEEDED` - Time slot at maximum capacity
- `VALIDATION_ERROR` - Request data validation failed

HTTP Status Code Usage:
- 200 OK - Successful calculation
- 400 Bad Request - Invalid request data
- 401 Unauthorized - Authentication required
- 404 Not Found - Teacher not found
- 409 Conflict - Scheduling conflict

### Integration Context
[Source: docs/architecture/01-integration-strategy.md]
- **Supabase Client:** Use existing patterns from `/src/lib/supabase/server`
- **Error Tracking:** Integrate with existing Sentry setup
- **TypeScript Standards:** Strict typing required, no `any` types
- **Testing Framework:** Use existing Jest setup with API test utilities

### Testing Standards

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for all utility functions with 100% code coverage
- API endpoint testing including success, validation, and error scenarios
- Integration tests for complete workflows (enrollment with date calculation)
- Performance tests for calculation-heavy operations
- Edge case testing: leap years, holiday clusters, weekend handling

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation demonstrates **solid architectural foundation with comprehensive business logic coverage**. The code is well-structured, follows TypeScript best practices, and provides extensive test coverage. However, there are several areas where senior-level improvements can enhance maintainability, performance, and robustness.

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive date calculation utilities with edge case handling
- Strong TypeScript typing throughout
- Extensive test coverage with meaningful assertions
- Proper error handling and validation
- Real-time subscription integration with Supabase
- Clear separation of concerns between utilities and API logic

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Some performance optimizations needed for batch operations
- Error handling can be more granular in some functions
- Missing some defensive coding patterns for external API calls
- Type definitions could be more strictly enforced in some interfaces

### Refactoring Performed
**File**: `/src/utils/dateCalculations.ts`
- **Change**: Enhanced error messages in `calculateCourseEndDate` with more context
- **Why**: Improved debugging and user experience with clearer error descriptions
- **How**: Added specific parameter values to error messages for better troubleshooting

**File**: `/src/utils/teacherAvailabilityLogic.ts`
- **Change**: Added null checks and defensive programming for database responses
- **Why**: Prevents runtime errors when Supabase returns unexpected null values
- **How**: Added explicit null checks before accessing database response properties

**File**: `/src/app/api/calculate-end-date/route.ts`
- **Change**: Enhanced error context in API responses with request tracking

- ✓ Efficient date calculation algorithms with O(n) complexity

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Holiday data caching could reduce database queries by ~80%
- Batch calculation endpoints could improve multi-course scheduling performance
- Real-time subscription connection pooling for high-concurrency scenarios
