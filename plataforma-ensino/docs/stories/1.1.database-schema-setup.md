# Story 1.1: Database Schema Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** database tables for holidays and teacher availability created with proper indexes and RLS policies,
**so that** the scheduling system has a solid foundation for storing and managing availability data.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create holidays table with proper schema (id, date, name, year, is_national, timestamps)
2. Create teacher_availability table with relationships to existing teachers table
3. Add scheduling columns to existing teachers table (max_students_per_class, calendar_settings)
4. Implement proper indexes for performance (date, teacher_id, day_of_week)
5. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies for both tables
6. Seed initial holiday data with 2025 Brazilian national holidays
7. All database changes must be additive (no breaking changes to existing schema)
8. Migration scripts must be reversible and production-ready

## Dev Notes

### Database Schema Context
[Source: docs/architecture/02-data-models.md]

**holidays table specifications:**
- Primary key: UUID with gen_random_uuid() default
- Core fields: date (DATE), name (VARCHAR 255), year (INTEGER), is_national (BOOLEAN)
- Audit fields: created_at, updated_at (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
- Indexes: date, year, unique constraint on date
- RLS: Public read access, admin write access only

**teacher_availability table specifications:**
- Primary key: UUID with gen_random_uuid() default  
- Foreign key: teacher_id references existing teachers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
- Core fields: day_of_week (INTEGER 0-6), start_time/end_time (TIME), max_students (INTEGER), is_active (BOOLEAN)
- Constraints: day_of_week CHECK (0-6), positive max_students
- Indexes: teacher_id, day_of_week, is_active (WHERE is_active = true)
- RLS: Teachers manage own availability, students view active slots, admin full access

**teachers table extensions:**
- New columns: max_students_per_class (INTEGER DEFAULT 10), calendar_settings (JSONB DEFAULT '{}')
- Constraints: max_students_per_class must be positive
- Backward compatibility: All existing queries continue working unchanged

### API Integration Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/04-api-design.md]
- Database tables will be accessed through new API endpoints (/api/holidays, /api/teachers/*/availability)
- Authentication uses existing Supabase Auth middleware patterns
- Error handling follows existing API error response format with structured codes

### Project Integration Rules
[Source: docs/architecture/01-integration-strategy.md]
- All database changes must be additive only - no modifications to existing schema
- Must maintain existing RLS patterns and security policies
- Performance impact should be minimal - new features are opt-in
- Migration strategy must support production rollback capability

### Testing Standards
**Database Testing Requirements:**
- All migrations must be tested in isolated development environment first
- Foreign key constraints and cascade behaviors must be validated
- RLS policies must be tested with different user roles (public, student, teacher, admin)
- Performance impact of new indexes should be measured
- Rollback procedures must be tested to ensure data integrity
- Existing application queries must continue working without modification

**Test File Locations:**
- Migration tests should be created alongside migration files
- Integration tests for RLS policies in existing test suite structure
- Holiday data seeding validation should include uniqueness and completeness checks

### 2025 Holiday Data to Seed

- Confraternização Universal (Jan 1)

## QA Results

### Review Date: July 22, 2025
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
**Overall Implementation Quality: EXCELLENT**

The database schema implementation demonstrates high-quality, production-ready code that follows PostgreSQL and Supabase best practices. All migrations are well-structured with comprehensive constraints, proper indexing strategies, and robust RLS policies. The implementation shows excellent attention to detail with rollback procedures, comprehensive test coverage, and proper error handling.

The developer correctly identified that the existing table is named `instructors` (not `teachers` as specified in the requirements) and adapted the implementation accordingly. This shows good practical problem-solving skills and attention to existing codebase patterns.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `database/006_create_teacher_availability_table.sql`
  - **Change**: Fixed EXCLUDE constraint to use proper `tsrange()` function instead of complex timestamp conversion and added required `btree_gist` extension
  - **Why**: The original constraint used unnecessary timestamp conversion that could cause performance issues and potential timezone complications
  - **How**: Simplified to use PostgreSQL's native `tsrange(start_time, end_time, '[)')` which is more efficient and clearer. Added extension requirement at the top of the migration to ensure constraint works properly.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ **PASS** - Follows consistent PostgreSQL patterns, proper naming conventions, comprehensive comments
- Project Structure: ✓ **PASS** - Migration files follow existing numbering pattern (005-008), proper database directory structure
- Testing Strategy: ✓ **PASS** - Comprehensive test files for each migration plus integration tests, edge case validation
- All ACs Met: ✓ **PASS** - All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented with additional quality improvements

### Improvements Checklist
[All items handled by QA review - no remaining tasks for developer]

- [x] Fixed EXCLUDE constraint implementation for proper time range overlap detection
- [x] Added required PostgreSQL extension (btree_gist) for advanced constraint
- [x] Validated all foreign key relationships target correct existing tables
- [x] Confirmed all RLS policies follow existing security patterns
- [x] Verified backward compatibility with existing application queries
- [x] Validated comprehensive rollback procedures in all migration files
- [x] Confirmed test coverage includes constraint validation and security policies

### Security Review
**EXCELLENT** - All security requirements properly implemented:
- RLS enabled on all new tables with appropriate policies
- Admin-only write access for holidays (system data)
- Teacher self-management for availability with public read of active slots
- Proper foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
- Check constraints prevent invalid data states
- No SQL injection vulnerabilities in any dynamic queries

### Performance Considerations
**WELL OPTIMIZED** - Performance considerations properly addressed:
- Strategic indexes created for expected query patterns (date ranges, teacher lookups, active availability)
- Partial indexes used where appropriate (e.g., `WHERE is_active = true`)
- Composite indexes for multi-column queries
- EXCLUDE constraint optimized with proper range functions
- No N+1 query patterns introduced
- Updated timestamp triggers properly implemented

### Final Status
✓ **APPROVED - Ready for Done**

**Summary**: This is exemplary database schema work that exceeds expectations. The implementation is production-ready, follows all best practices, includes comprehensive testing, and demonstrates excellent understanding of PostgreSQL/Supabase capabilities. The minor optimization performed during QA review further strengthens an already solid implementation.

**Deployment Readiness**: All migration files are ready for immediate production deployment. Execute in order: 005 → 006 → 007 → 008.
