# Story 3.1: Database Foundation Setup

## Status
approved

## Story
**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** to establish the database foundation for teacher scheduling with holidays and availability tables,
**so that** the scheduling system has the necessary data structures to support teacher-student class scheduling.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Holidays Table Creation**: Create holidays table with proper schema, indexes, and RLS policies to store Brazilian national holidays and support course end date calculations
2. **Teacher Availability Table Creation**: Create teacher_availability table with relationships to existing instructors table, time slot management, and overlap prevention constraints
3. **Holiday Data Seeding**: Populate holidays table with 2025 Brazilian national holidays including all major holidays that affect class scheduling
4. **API Foundation Setup**: Create basic REST API endpoints for holidays CRUD operations with proper authentication and error handling
5. **Database Performance Optimization**: Implement proper indexes and constraints for efficient querying of availability and holiday data
6. **Row Level Security Implementation**: Configure RLS policies for secure access to holidays (public read, admin write) and teacher availability (teacher manages own, public views active)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.2 successfully implemented teacher calendar visual enhancements with completion status indicators. The system now has robust date calculation utilities and calendar integration patterns that will be leveraged for the new scheduling system. The architecture uses Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Supabase with established patterns for database interactions and API endpoints.

### Data Models
**Holidays Table**: Core table for course end date calculations
- `id`: UUID primary key for unique holiday identification
- `date`: DATE field with unique constraint to prevent duplicate holidays
- `name`: VARCHAR(255) for holiday description (e.g., "Natal", "Carnaval")
- `year`: INTEGER with consistency check constraint matching date year
- `is_national`: BOOLEAN to distinguish national vs regional holidays
- `created_at`/`updated_at`: Automatic timestamp management with triggers
- **Constraints**: date uniqueness, year consistency, non-empty name validation

**Teacher Availability Table**: Core table for scheduling time slots
- `id`: UUID primary key for availability slot identification
- `teacher_id`: UUID foreign key to instructors table with CASCADE delete
- `day_of_week`: INTEGER (0-6, Sunday to Saturday) for weekly recurring slots
- `start_time`/`end_time`: TIME fields for class duration definition
- `max_students`: INTEGER for capacity management (default 1)
- `is_active`: BOOLEAN for enabling/disabling availability slots
- **Constraints**: valid day_of_week range, positive max_students, start < end time
- **Advanced Constraint**: EXCLUDE constraint preventing overlapping time slots using btree_gist extension
[Source: database/006_create_teacher_availability_table.sql]

**Holiday Seeding Data**: 2025 Brazilian national holidays
- Complete set of 12 major Brazilian holidays including Carnaval, Easter, and national celebrations
- ON CONFLICT handling for safe re-running of seeding scripts
- Proper date formatting and national holiday classification

### API Specifications
**Holidays API Endpoints**: RESTful API for holiday management
- **Base Path**: `/api/holidays` following existing API structure patterns
- **Authentication**: Uses existing Supabase Auth with admin role verification
- **GET /api/holidays**: Query holidays by year or date range with optional filtering
- **POST /api/holidays**: Admin-only endpoint for creating holidays with validation
- **PUT /api/holidays/[id]**: Admin-only endpoint for updating holiday information
- **DELETE /api/holidays/[id]**: Admin-only endpoint for holiday removal
- **Response Format**: Consistent with existing API patterns using JSON responses
- **Error Handling**: Integration with existing Sentry error logging and Toast notification system
[Source: architecture/6-design-e-integrao-de-api.md#62-endpoints-de-api-modificados]

**Teacher Availability API** (Future Phase): Planned endpoints for availability management
- **GET /api/teacher-availability**: Retrieve availability for teacher selection
- **POST /api/teacher-availability**: Teachers create their own availability slots
- **PUT /api/teacher-availability/[id]**: Teachers update their own slots
- Following same authentication and RLS patterns as holidays API

**Database Query Patterns**:
```sql
-- Example holiday query for course end date calculation
SELECT date FROM public.holidays 
WHERE year = $1 AND is_national = true 
ORDER BY date;

-- Example teacher availability query for scheduling
SELECT * FROM public.teacher_availability 
WHERE teacher_id = $1 AND day_of_week = $2 AND is_active = true;
```
