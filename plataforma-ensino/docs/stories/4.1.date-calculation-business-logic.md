## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.1 successfully established the database foundation with holidays and teacher_availability tables, complete with RLS policies and comprehensive API endpoints. The system now has a solid data layer with 2025 Brazilian holidays seeded and teacher availability structure ready for business logic implementation. The architecture follows Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Supabase patterns with established error handling and testing frameworks.

### Data Models
**Holidays Table Integration**: Core table for date calculations
- Database structure: id (UUID), date (DATE), name (VARCHAR), year (INTEGER), is_national (BOOLEAN)
- Business logic integration: Query holidays by year and national status for accurate date exclusions
- Performance optimization: Indexed on date, year, and is_national columns for fast queries
- Data integrity: Unique constraint on date prevents duplicate holidays affecting calculations

**Teacher Availability Table Integration**: Core table for scheduling business logic
- Database structure: teacher_id (UUID FK), day_of_week (INTEGER), start_time/end_time (TIME), max_students (INTEGER), is_active (BOOLEAN)
- Business logic patterns: Query by teacher_id and day_of_week for availability checking
- Capacity management: max_students field enables enrollment limit tracking per time slot
- Overlap prevention: EXCLUDE constraint prevents conflicting time slots for same teacher
[Source: architecture/4-modelos-de-dados-e-alteraes-de-esquema.md#teacher-availability-table]

**StudentSchedule Data Model**: New model for enrollment scheduling (from architecture)
- Structure: enrollment_id (UUID FK), instructor_id (UUID FK), day_of_week (INTEGER), start_time/end_time (TIME)
- Integration: Links enrollments with specific teacher availability slots
- Business logic: Validates against teacher availability and capacity constraints
- Performance: Indexed on enrollment_id for efficient enrollment queries
