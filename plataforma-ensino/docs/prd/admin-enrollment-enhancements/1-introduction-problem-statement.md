# 1. Introduction & Problem Statement

## 1.1. Problem
The current admin enrollment process is not equipped to handle the distinct needs of in-person ("presencial") versus online student enrollments. Administrators require a manual, error-prone workaround to schedule in-person students and calculate their correct course end dates.

## 1.2. Opportunity
By intelligently enhancing the **existing admin enrollment page**, we can provide a single, streamlined interface that handles all enrollment types. This includes integrating our powerful, pre-built scheduling components and automating the end-date calculation based on modality and holiday schedules.
