## Risk Mitigation During Implementation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Migration Issues**: Test all migrations in staging environment first
- **Performance Degradation**: Monitor response times and implement caching as needed
- **Integration Conflicts**: Maintain backward compatibility with existing systems
- **Data Inconsistencies**: Implement comprehensive validation and error handling

### User Experience Risks
- **Enrollment Flow Disruption**: Use feature flags to control rollout and enable quick rollback
- **Learning Curve**: Provide comprehensive documentation and user training
- **Accessibility Issues**: Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **Mobile Experience**: Ensure responsive design works across all devices

### Business Risks
- **Teacher Adoption**: Provide training and support for teachers setting up availability
- **Student Confusion**: Clear communication about new scheduling features
- **Operational Overhead**: Admin training for holiday management and conflict resolution
- **Support Load**: Prepare customer support team for scheduling-related questions
