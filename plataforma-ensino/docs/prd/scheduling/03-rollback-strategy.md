# Rollback Strategy & Risk Mitigation

## Comprehensive Rollback Plan

### Database Rollback Procedures

**Rollback Scripts:**
- Pre-written rollback migrations for each schema change
- Data preservation scripts for existing course enrollments
- Automated backup verification before any schema changes

**Rollback Sequence:**
1. **Phase 3 Rollback**: Remove UI components, restore original enrollment flow
2. **Phase 2 Rollback**: Disable API endpoints, remove business logic
3. **Phase 1 Rollback**: Drop new tables, remove foreign key relationships
4. **Data Verification**: Confirm existing system functionality restored

### Feature Flag Strategy

**Gradual Rollback Control:**
- `ENABLE_TEACHER_SCHEDULING` - Master feature toggle
- `ENABLE_HOLIDAY_MANAGEMENT` - Admin holiday features
- `ENABLE_CALENDAR_DISPLAY` - Student-facing calendar
- `ENABLE_AVAILABILITY_API` - Teacher availability endpoints

**Progressive Rollback:**
- Disable features by user percentage (100% → 50% → 25% → 0%)
- Automatic rollback triggers on error rate >2%
- Admin override capability for immediate full rollback

### User Impact Mitigation

#### During Rollback Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Emergency Rollback During Enrollment**
- **User Impact**: Students mid-enrollment redirected to original flow
- **Mitigation**: Auto-save enrollment progress, seamless transition message
- **Recovery**: "Technical update in progress. Your enrollment has been saved and you can complete it using our standard process."

**Scenario 2: Data Inconsistency Issues**  
- **User Impact**: Scheduling conflicts or duplicate bookings
- **Mitigation**: Automated conflict detection and resolution
- **Recovery**: Direct admin intervention with student communication

**Scenario 3: Performance Degradation**
- **User Impact**: Slow page loads or calendar timeouts
- **Mitigation**: Automatic fallback to simplified enrollment flow
- **Recovery**: "Simplified enrollment mode active. Full scheduling features will return shortly."

### Business Continuity Measures

**Enrollment Flow Preservation:**
- Original enrollment process remains fully functional during rollback
- No data loss for students enrolled through old or new systems  
- Course progress tracking continues unaffected
- Payment processing (when implemented) maintains continuity

**Teacher Schedule Management:**
- Manual schedule management available as fallback
- Admin tools for schedule conflict resolution
- Direct teacher-student communication channels maintained

**Student Communication Protocol:**
- Automated email notifications for affected enrollments
- Clear explanation of temporary changes
- Alternative enrollment instructions
- Estimated timeline for feature restoration

## Risk Assessment & Monitoring

### Pre-Implementation Risk Analysis

**High Risk Factors:**
1. **Database Schema Changes** - Could affect existing course data
   - *Mitigation*: Additive-only changes, comprehensive testing
2. **Enrollment Flow Modifications** - Could break student registration  
   - *Mitigation*: Feature flags, parallel flow testing
3. **Teacher Availability Logic** - Complex business rules could fail
   - *Mitigation*: Extensive unit testing, staged rollout

**Medium Risk Factors:**
1. **Calendar Component Performance** - Could slow page loads
   - *Mitigation*: Performance budgets, lazy loading
2. **Real-time Updates** - Websocket connections could fail
   - *Mitigation*: Graceful degradation to polling updates

### Monitoring & Alert System

**Critical Metrics Monitoring:**
- Enrollment completion rate (baseline >85%)
- Calendar component load time (threshold <500ms)  
- API error rates (threshold <1%)
- Database query performance (threshold <100ms)
- User session abandonment during enrollment

**Automated Rollback Triggers:**
- Error rate exceeds 2% for >5 minutes
- Enrollment completion drops below 70%
- Critical database connection failures
- Calendar load time exceeds 2 seconds consistently

**Manual Intervention Triggers:**
- User complaints exceed 5 per hour
- Teacher availability conflicts detected
- Holiday data inconsistencies identified
- Payment processing issues (future consideration)

## Post-Rollback Recovery

### System Health Verification
1. **Database Integrity Check** - Verify all existing data preserved
2. **Enrollment Flow Testing** - Confirm original process fully functional
3. **User Access Verification** - Test all user roles can access their features
4. **Performance Baseline** - Confirm system performance restored to pre-enhancement levels

### Incident Documentation
- **Root Cause Analysis** - Document what triggered rollback
- **Impact Assessment** - Quantify user and business impact
- **Recovery Timeline** - Track time to full system restoration
- **Lessons Learned** - Update procedures for future enhancements

### Communication Plan
- **User Notification** - Email to all affected users with status update
- **Stakeholder Briefing** - Management update on rollback and next steps
- **Public Status** - Website banner or status page update if needed

## Rollback Testing Strategy

### Pre-Production Rollback Testing
- **Database Rollback Simulation** - Test all migration reversals in staging
- **Feature Flag Testing** - Verify progressive disable functionality
- **User Flow Testing** - Confirm graceful degradation to original enrollment
- **Performance Testing** - Validate system performance after rollback

### Production Rollback Procedures
- **Incident Response Team** - 24/7 availability during initial deployment
- **Communication Templates** - Pre-written user notifications and status updates
- **Rollback Decision Matrix** - Clear criteria for rollback initiation
- **Recovery Time Objectives** - Target <30 minutes for critical rollbacks
