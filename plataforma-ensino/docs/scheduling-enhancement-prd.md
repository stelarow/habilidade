## Rollback Strategy & Risk Mitigation

### Comprehensive Rollback Plan

#### Database Rollback Procedures
**Rollback Scripts:**
- Pre-written rollback migrations for each schema change
- Data preservation scripts for existing course enrollments
- Automated backup verification before any schema changes

**Rollback Sequence:**
1. **Phase 3 Rollback**: Remove UI components, restore original enrollment flow
2. **Phase 2 Rollback**: Disable API endpoints, remove business logic
3. **Phase 1 Rollback**: Drop new tables, remove foreign key relationships
4. **Data Verification**: Confirm existing system functionality restored

#### Feature Flag Strategy
**Gradual Rollback Control:**
- `ENABLE_TEACHER_SCHEDULING` - Master feature toggle
- `ENABLE_HOLIDAY_MANAGEMENT` - Admin holiday features
- `ENABLE_CALENDAR_DISPLAY` - Student-facing calendar
- `ENABLE_AVAILABILITY_API` - Teacher availability endpoints

**Progressive Rollback:**
- Disable features by user percentage (100% → 50% → 25% → 0%)
- Automatic rollback triggers on error rate >2%
- Admin override capability for immediate full rollback

#### User Impact Mitigation

#### During Rollback Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Emergency Rollback During Enrollment**
- **User Impact**: Students mid-enrollment redirected to original flow
- **Mitigation**: Auto-save enrollment progress, seamless transition message
- **Recovery**: "Technical update in progress. Your enrollment has been saved and you can complete it using our standard process."

**Scenario 2: Data Inconsistency Issues**  
- **User Impact**: Scheduling conflicts or duplicate bookings
- **Mitigation**: Automated conflict detection and resolution
- **Recovery**: Direct admin intervention with student communication

**Scenario 3: Performance Degradation**
- **User Impact**: Slow page loads or calendar timeouts
- **Mitigation**: Automatic fallback to simplified enrollment flow
- **Recovery**: "Simplified enrollment mode active. Full scheduling features will return shortly."

#### Business Continuity Measures

**Enrollment Flow Preservation:**
- Original enrollment process remains fully functional during rollback
- No data loss for students enrolled through old or new systems  
- Course progress tracking continues unaffected
- Payment processing (when implemented) maintains continuity

**Teacher Schedule Management:**
- Manual schedule management available as fallback
- Admin tools for schedule conflict resolution
- Direct teacher-student communication channels maintained

**Student Communication Protocol:**
- Automated email notifications for affected enrollments
- Clear explanation of temporary changes
- Alternative enrollment instructions
- Estimated timeline for feature restoration

### Risk Assessment & Monitoring
