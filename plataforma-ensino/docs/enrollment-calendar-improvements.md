# Enrollment Calendar System Improvements

## Overview

The enrollment form calendar system has been simplified from a complex monthly calendar view to a streamlined weekly schedule display, improving usability and performance.

## Problem

The original system used `ConditionalCalendar` component which was overly complex:
- Complex monthly calendar with navigation
- Too many features not needed for simple scheduling
- Difficult for admins to quickly see weekly availability
- Poor UX for selecting class times

## Solution

Implemented `SimplifiedWeeklySchedule` component with:

### Weekly Format Display
```
Segunda feira
08:00 às 10:00 2/3 vagas preenchidas
10:00 às 12:00 3/3 vagas preenchidas
13:30 às 15:30 0/3 vagas preenchidas
15:30 às 17:30 2/3 vagas preenchidas
18:00 às 20:00 3/3 vagas preenchidas
20:00 às 22:00 0/3 vagas preenchidas
```

### Standard Teacher Schedule
All teachers now have standardized availability:
- **Monday to Friday**: 08:00-10:00, 10:00-12:00, 13:30-15:30, 15:30-17:30, 18:00-20:00, 20:00-22:00
- **Saturday**: 08:00-10:00, 10:00-12:00
- **Sunday**: No classes

Each time slot supports up to 3 students by default.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Components
- `src/components/enrollment/SimplifiedWeeklySchedule.tsx` - New simplified calendar component

### Modified Components
- `src/components/scheduling/SchedulingSection.tsx` - Updated to use simplified calendar
- `src/lib/seed-data.ts` - Added sample instructors and availability data

### Test Files
- `src/app/test-simplified-calendar/page.tsx` - Test page for the new system

## Key Features

### 1. Simplified Interface
- Clear weekly view (Monday to Saturday)
- Time slots with availability counters
- Visual status indicators (available/full/selected)

### 2. Teacher Selection Integration
- Works seamlessly with existing TeacherSelector
- Loads real availability from database
- Shows current occupancy levels

### 3. Flexible Selection
- Single class or two classes per week
- Clear selection feedback
- Selected slots summary

### 4. Database Integration
- Uses `teacher_availability` table for base schedules
- Counts `student_schedules` for current occupancy
- Real-time availability calculations

## Database Schema Usage

### teacher_availability
- `teacher_id` - References instructors table
- `day_of_week` - 1-6 (Monday-Saturday)
- `start_time`/`end_time` - Time slots
- `max_students` - Capacity per slot

### student_schedules
- `enrollment_id` - Links to student enrollment
- `instructor_id` - References users table (teacher's user_id)
- `day_of_week`/`start_time`/`end_time` - Scheduled times

## Usage

### In Enrollment Form
```tsx
<SimplifiedWeeklySchedule
  teacherId={selectedTeacherId}
  onSlotSelect={(slot1, slot2) => handleSlotSelection(slot1, slot2)}
  selectedSlots={selectedSlots}
  maxSelectableSlots={hasTwoClassesPerWeek ? 2 : 1}
  hasTwoClassesPerWeek={hasTwoClassesPerWeek}
/>
```

### Testing
Visit `/test-simplified-calendar` to test the component with sample data.

## Benefits

1. **Improved UX**: Clear, simple interface for selecting class times
2. **Better Performance**: Lighter component without complex calendar logic
3. **Standardization**: Consistent schedule format across all teachers
4. **Real-time Data**: Shows actual availability and occupancy
5. **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design works well on all devices

## Future Enhancements

- Custom availability per teacher
- Holiday integration
- Bulk schedule operations
- Advanced filtering options

## Migration Notes

The old `ConditionalCalendar` component is still available but not used. It can be safely removed in a future cleanup.

## Seed Data

Run the seed function to create sample teachers with standard schedules:
```typescript
import { seedSampleInstructors } from '@/lib/seed-data'
await seedSampleInstructors()
```

This creates 3 sample instructors with full weekly availability.
