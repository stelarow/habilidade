As a result, you will get a list of relevant keyword ideas for up to 200 seed keywords.
Along with each keyword idea, you will get its search volume rate for the last month, search volume trend for the previous 12 months, as well as current cost-per-click and competition values. Moreover, this endpoint supplies minimum, maximum and average values of daily impressions, clicks and CPC for each result.

optional field
you can use the same values as in the filters array to sort the results
possible sorting types:
asc – results will be sorted in the ascending order
desc – results will be sorted in the descending order
you should use a comma to set up a sorting parameter
default rule:
["relevance,desc"]
relevance is used as the default sorting rule to provide you with the closest keyword ideas. We recommend using this sorting rule to get highly-relevant search terms. Note that relevance is only our internal system identifier, so it can not be used as a filter, and you will not find this field in the result array. The relevance score is based on a similar principle as used in the Keywords For Keywords endpoint.
note that you can set no more than three sorting rules in a single request
you should use a comma to separate several sorting rules
example:
["relevance,desc","keyword_info.search_volume,desc"]`
