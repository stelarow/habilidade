You will get search volume, competition, cost-per-click and impressions data on each intersecting keyword. Along with that, you will get data on SERP elements that specified pages rank for in search results, as well as the estimated traffic volume and cost of ad traffic. Page Intersection endpoint supports organic, paid, local pack and featured snippet results.

Find keywords several webpages rank for:
If you would like to get the keywords several pages rank for, you need to specify webpages only in the pages object. This way, you will receive intersected ranked keywords for the specified URLs.

Find keywords your competitors rank for but you do not:
If you would like to receive all keywords several pages rank for, but particular pages do not, you need to use the exclude_pages array as well. This way you will receive the keywords for which the URLs from the pages object rank for, but the URLs from the exclude_pages array do not`;

search for the example.com page and all its related URLs which start with '/eng/', such as "example.com/eng/index.html" and "example.com/eng/help/", etc.
