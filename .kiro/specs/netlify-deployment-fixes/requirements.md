# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The learning platform is failing to deploy on Netlify due to several critical issues: dynamic server usage during static generation, PDF.js server-side rendering compatibility problems, and missing Sentry configuration. This feature will resolve these deployment blockers to enable successful production builds and deployments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want the application to build successfully on Netlify, so that I can deploy updates to production without build failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL complete without exit code errors
2. WHEN API routes are accessed during build THEN the system SHALL handle dynamic server usage appropriately
3. WHEN static generation occurs THEN the system SHALL not attempt to use cookies in static contexts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want PDF.js to work correctly in server-side rendering, so that lesson content displays properly without runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PDF components are rendered server-side THEN the system SHALL handle missing DOM APIs gracefully
2. WHEN the test-lesson page is generated THEN the system SHALL not throw DOMMatrix undefined errors
3. WHEN PDF.js is used THEN the system SHALL use appropriate build configurations for SSR compatibility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Sentry configuration, so that error monitoring works correctly without blocking deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Sentry is configured THEN the system SHALL upload source maps only when auth token is available
2. WHEN SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN is missing THEN the system SHALL continue building without failing
3. WHEN in production THEN the system SHALL hide source maps from browser devtools

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want API routes to work correctly in production, so that authentication and admin functions operate properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API routes handle authentication THEN the system SHALL use appropriate runtime configurations
2. WHEN admin API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL handle session verification without static generation conflicts
3. WHEN cookies are required THEN the system SHALL mark routes as dynamic appropriately
